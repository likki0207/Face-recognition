# Face-recognition:
Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time

# Packages required:
(a) opencv : It is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

# About the haarcascade file:
In this project we will be using the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml which is a haar cascade designed by OpenCV to detect the frontal face. This haar cascade is available on github. A Haar Cascade works by training the cascade on thousands of negative images with the positive image superimposed on it.

# Steps to build this project
(a) Import the required libraries
(b) Include the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
(c)  Open the inbuilt Camera
(d) Now we will capture the frames from the camera
(e) Get the gray scaled image
(f) Draw a rectangle around the faces
(g) Display the resulting frame i.e, the output
(h) When everything is done, release the capture

# Execution:
run the program by using the following command:

-> python face_rec.py
